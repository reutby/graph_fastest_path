###Find the fastest path in a graph### 
########################################

1. The file find_shortest_path.py contain the algorithm and the main function.

2. There are two exmples .csv files (exmple1 and exmple2) that contains two adjacency
   matrixs which represent the graph edges and weight. asuuming that the csv
   files orgenized correctly as expected, with positive weight only.   
   
3. I perform six tests total on both exmpeles, you just need to run the main program 
   find_shortest_path.py in order to see the results.

4. I compared the results i got with simulation i found on the internet: 
   https://graphonline.ru/en/ 

5. I added three print screens represents the correct result from the graph online website
   for positive tests number 1-3.
   
enjoy.. :)
